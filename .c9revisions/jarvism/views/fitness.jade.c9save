For the last few years before he died, he couldn't breathe well enough to enjoy anything. I have come to have a deep, abiding respect for this truism. No matter how much stuff I have, if my body doesn't feel good, I don't feel good. Therefore, I believe that fitness is its own reward. As a matter of fact, exercise is number one on the list of things that optimize brain function in John Medina's book <em>Brain Rules</em>. I just want to feel really good and have lots of energy. That's how I roll.\n\n    hr.featurette-divider"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":2109}]],"length":2109,"saved":false}
