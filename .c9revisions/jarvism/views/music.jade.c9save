I asked for a drum set almost immediately, but my mom said no way (of course, right?). So, one day when Mom was at work, I built a makeshift kit out of stuff I found around the house. Mom came home to a cacophony (I wasn't that good yet) born of cymbal-like objects suspended from the ceiling of my room by bits of yarn and string, our biggest cooking pot as a bass drum, and generally a mystifying example of a modern art masterpiece. With resignation in her eye, she finally acquiesced, and Santa Clause came early that year, bearing the cheapest drum kit from our local music store.\n\n    hr.featurette-divider"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":2233}]],"length":2233,"saved":false}
