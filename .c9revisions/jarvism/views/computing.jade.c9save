The single most attractive aspect of working with computers (for me) is that I can solve problems according to a given set of rules determined by the programming language, API, etc., and outcomes are more or less concrete--it either works, or it doesn't. I like a certain lack of ambiguity, and I like finding creative, elegant, and logical ways to make things do what they are supposed to do--or do them better. This is the part of design that really fascinates me.  It's like we can build anything we can think of, and the only limitation is our ability to imagine something better.\n\n    hr.featurette-divider"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":2369}]],"length":2369,"saved":false}
